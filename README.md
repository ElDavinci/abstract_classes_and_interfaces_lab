## Getting Started

lab9 cpcs203<br>
Description:<br>
The following program does not compile. Fix all the syntax errors so that the program will compile
successfully. Once the program compiles, execute the program, and compare the output with the sample
output; then eliminate any logic errors that may exist. The sample output demonstrates what the program’s
output should be once the program’s code is corrected.
## Learning Objectives

• Design and use abstract classes and abstract methods<br>
• Specify common behavior for objects using interfaces<br>
• Define interfaces and define classes that implement interfaces<br>
• Define classes that implement interfaces using the implements keyword.<br>
• Apply polymorphic referencing.<br>
• Invoke methods through polymorphic referencing.<br>

## how to run
(1) clone repo <br>
(2) open src -> App.java in vscode (preferably) <br>
(3) run the code <br>
Simple huh :0
